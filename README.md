# Modern Multiset [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/modern-multiset.svg?maxAge=86400)](https://crates.io/crates/modern-multiset) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/modern-multiset/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/modern-multiset)

A multiset is an unordered collection of values.

Unlike sets where each value is either included or not, multisets permit duplicates. Consequently, they're useful for maintaining a count of distinct values.

See the documentation of [HashMultiSet](https://docs.rs/modern-multiset/latest/modern-multiset/struct.HashMultiSet.html) for examples.
